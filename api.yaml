  description: |
    API for the Compass service. This service provides control-based attribute enrichment for telemetry data,
    leveraging internal domain logic and the Compass project's compliance knowledge.
    It's designed to be called by an OpenTelemetry Collector's custom processor to enrich logs, metrics, and traces.

      summary: Enrich telemetry attributes with compliance control data
      description: |
        Accepts a set of key telemetry attributes (e.g., asset ID, policy name, user ID) and
        returns additional compliance-related attributes based on internal domain logic.
        This endpoint is intended to be called by an OpenTelemetry Collector's custom processor.
